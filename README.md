# LOUIS JOSEPH — INTERFACE ARCHITECT

Standard tools produce standard results. I engineer custom high-fidelity systems at the intersection of **Generative AI** and **Frontend Architecture**—building the tools I wish existed.

---

### 🧪 CURRENT R&D: THE GENERATIVE LAYER
*Moving from manual pixels to intent-based rendering.*

- **Gen UI via DSL**: Abstracting UI development into a custom Domain-Specific Language. I’m building a way to transform natural language intent into functional, production-ready interfaces—bypassing the traditional design-to-code bottleneck.
- **Neural Pedagogy (Telebook)**: Developing an adaptive learning engine that deconstructs static syllabi into personalized, user-tuned LaTeX curriculum. It doesn't just display content; it evolves with the learner's performance.
- **Adaptive Compliance**: Reengineering ERP systems for precision tracking. Building a platform for automated, structured regulatory compliance and operational oversight.

### 🏗️ PRODUCTION SYSTEMS
*Deployed platforms and core collaborations.*

- **MarketMetrics** • [marketmetrics.ai](https://marketmetrics.ai/)  
  *Neural Signal Extraction.* Deciphering market volatility through AI-driven insights and financial intelligence.
- **BuzzChat** • [buzzchat.in](http://buzzchat.in/)  
  *Conversational Intelligence.* Synthesizing complex AI logic into intuitive, human-centric interaction patterns.
- **Noetic Laboratories** • [noeticlaboratories.com](https://noeticlaboratories.com/)  
  *Frontend Lead.* Engineering the digital infrastructure for a studio focused on next-gen AI research and creative technology.

### 🛠️ OVERRIDES & UTILITIES
*Building better versions of what already exists.*

- **[Spotify MultiJam](https://github.com/Amysoj-Louis/Spotify-MultiJam)**: Overriding standard session limits for concurrent remote playback control.
- **[AI PDF Intelligence](https://github.com/Amysoj-Louis/AI-Pdf-Question-Answering)**: Local RAG implementation for high-precision document parsing and Q&A.
- **[Tickertape Automation](https://github.com/Amysoj-Louis/Tickertape-Screener-unofficial)**: Custom data retrieval engine for financial screening.
